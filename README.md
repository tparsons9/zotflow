# ZotFlow — Keep Your Research in Flow

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> **Personal build:** `personal` is the default branch of `tparsons9/zotflow`.
> It retains the annotation-profile and category-layout work, with upstream
> attribution and plugin ID unchanged. See [Personal maintenance](#personal-maintenance)
> for reminders, updates, and installation into your own vault.

> **Your Zotero library, your reader, your notes — one seamless workspace inside Obsidian.**

ZotFlow is a community plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that brings the full power of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) into your vault. Read papers, annotate PDFs, generate templated source notes, and cite literature — all without ever leaving Obsidian.

## Why ZotFlow?

If any of these sound like you, ZotFlow was built for you:

- 📚 You want to **read and annotate PDFs/EPUBs** without switching between Zotero, a PDF viewer, and Obsidian.
- 🎨 You want your reader to **match your Obsidian theme** — dark mode, custom fonts, the works.
- 🔄 You want **true bidirectional sync** — annotations made in Obsidian flow back to Zotero, and vice versa.
- ✍️ You want every Zotero item to have an **auto-generated, template-driven source note** that always stays up to date.
- 🔗 You want to **cite literature** in Pandoc, Wikilink, Footnote, or raw citekey format — by drag-and-drop, autocomplete, or hotkey.
- 📂 You want to annotate **any PDF or EPUB already in your vault**, even ones that aren't in Zotero.
- 🛡️ You want an **offline-first, privacy-respecting** tool with no telemetry and secure credential storage.

## What You Can Do With ZotFlow

### 🪟 Read & Annotate Inside Obsidian

A full-featured PDF/EPUB/HTML reader, embedded right in your workspace and **themed to match Obsidian**. Highlight, underline, draw, add sticky notes, capture image regions — every annotation type Zotero supports, in a window that finally feels like home.

![Built-in Reader](assets/reader.gif)

### 🔄 True Bidirectional Sync

Pull items, metadata, and annotations from Zotero — and push your changes back. Configure each library independently as **Bidirectional**, **Read-Only**, or **Ignored**. Sync works like Zotero's own: changes to different fields (or different tags) on both sides merge automatically, and only a field changed differently on both sides — or an item deleted on one side and changed on the other — becomes a conflict. A field-level diff viewer lets you decide what to keep; items deleted in Zotero together are resolved together.

![Bidirectional Sync](assets/sync.gif)

### ✨ Template-Powered Source Notes

Every Zotero item gets one auto-generated Markdown note, rendered with [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com) templates you fully control.

![Source Notes](assets/source-notes.gif)

### 🗒️ Native Zotero Item Notes

Create, edit, and delete **Zotero child notes** without leaving Obsidian. Right-click any item in the Tree View to add a note, edit it in a dedicated tab with Obsidian's full Markdown editor, or unlock its region inside the parent source note and edit in place. Every change auto-saves and syncs back to Zotero.

![Item Notes](assets/item-notes.gif)

### 📝 Annotate Any Vault File

Have PDFs or EPUBs that aren't in Zotero? Open them with the same reader. Annotations save into a co-located `.zf.json` sidecar — no Zotero account required. Perfect for personal notes, downloaded papers, or books you're reading.

![Local Reader](assets/local-reader.gif)

### 📎 Multi-Format Citations

Insert citations as **Pandoc** (`[@key]`), **Wikilink** (`[[Source/@key|Author (year)]]`), **Footnote**, or raw **citekey** — via drag-and-drop from the tree view, autocomplete with a trigger string (`@@`), or copy-from-reader hotkeys. Include annotation context (page numbers, quoted text) automatically.

![Citations](assets/citations.gif)

### 🌳 Zotero Tree View & Search Modal

Browse your entire Zotero universe — libraries, collections, items, attachments — in a fast virtualized sidebar tree. Search, sort, drag, right-click. Click any attachment to open it; drag any item to cite it.

Or open the search modal from the command palette, type to filter your library, and hit Enter to jump to an item or open its attachment.

![Tree View](assets/tree-view.gif)

### 🛠️ And a Whole Lot More

- **WebDAV support** — download attachments from your self-hosted Zotero storage.
- **Linked attachment base directory** — works with Zotero's external file storage feature.
- **Batch operations** — generate every source note, extract every annotation image, re-render every template in one click.
- **Activity Center** — a control panel for sync progress, running tasks, and a searchable log console.
- **Offline-first** — everything cached locally in IndexedDB; the network is only used for Zotero and WebDAV.
- **Secure credentials** — API keys stored in Obsidian's platform-native `SecretStorage`, never in synced `data.json`.
- **Mobile-aware** — built to be mobile-safe (current mobile support is limited).

## Quick Start

New to ZotFlow? Start here:

👉 **[Read the docs website](https://zotflow.peterduan.dev/)** — the documentation site introduces ZotFlow's key concepts and design philosophy first, then walks you through installation and your first sync.

For the impatient:

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**, search for **ZotFlow**, install and enable it. (Or grab it from the [Obsidian plugin directory](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/zotflow).)
2. Create a [Zotero API key](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new) with read/write access.
3. Paste it into **Settings → ZotFlow → Sync** and click **Verify Key**.
4. Open the **Activity Center** (ribbon icon) → **Sync All**.
5. Open the **Zotero Tree View**, double-click an attachment, and start reading.

## Documentation

Read ZotFlow docs on the new website:

- **English:** [https://zotflow.peterduan.dev/](https://zotflow.peterduan.dev/)
- **简体中文:** [https://zotflow.peterduan.dev/zh](https://zotflow.peterduan.dev/zh)

Legacy Markdown docs are still available in [docs/](docs/README.md), but the website is the source of truth.

Direct link: [https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/zotflow](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/zotflow)

### Option 2 — Beta builds via BRAT

For pre-release builds, install via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat):

1. Install and enable **BRAT** from Community Plugins.
2. In BRAT's options, click **Add Beta plugin** and enter: `duanxianpi/obsidian-zotflow`
3. Enable **ZotFlow** in Community Plugins.

See the docs website for step-by-step setup: [https://zotflow.peterduan.dev/](https://zotflow.peterduan.dev/)

---

## Architecture

ZotFlow uses a **Main Thread + Web Worker** split for responsiveness:

- **Main thread** — Obsidian API, UI rendering (React for complex views, native APIs for settings).
- **Web Worker** — Zotero API calls, sync engine, IndexedDB (Dexie), template rendering, PDF processing.
- **Reader iframe** — Zotero's PDF/EPUB/HTML reader, embedded and sandboxed via penpal.

Communication: [Comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink) (main ↔ worker) and [Penpal](https://github.com/nicmeriano/penpal) (main ↔ reader iframe).

---

## Development

### Personal maintenance

This fork keeps a customized build on `personal`, while contribution PR branches
remain separate. The current base includes upstream development work after stable
1.6.6, including database schema 7. Future stable releases are merged into this
history; the build is not represented as stock 1.6.6 merely because its manifest
still carries the upstream version.

The reader is a pinned submodule of `tparsons9/obsidian-zotero-reader`. Push reader
commits to that fork before pushing parent commits that reference them. A fresh
checkout uses `git clone --recurse-submodules`, then `npm ci`. Configure the reader's
owner remote once with:

```bash
git -C reader/reader remote add upstream https://github.com/duanxianpi/obsidian-zotero-reader.git
```

**Reminders:** the weekly workflow checks stable ZotFlow releases and upstream reader
`master` commits every Monday at 15:17 UTC. Issues are created only in
`tparsons9/zotflow`, assigned to `tparsons9`, and labeled `upstream-update`. They do
not appear in the parent's issue list, although a public fork's issues are public.
Repeated targets produce no new notification; new targets update the corresponding
open issue and mention you. Closing an issue acknowledges its recorded targets
without changing the adopted baseline. Reader alerts can describe divergent branches:
upstream ZotFlow currently pins a reader commit from a different upstream branch.

```bash
npm run upstream:check -- --dry-run  # read-only diagnostic; needs gh auth or GH_TOKEN
gh workflow run upstream-check.yml --repo tparsons9/zotflow --ref personal
```

On upstream ZotFlow, select **Watch → Custom → Releases**. In GitHub's notification
settings, enable email for watching and participation/mentions, and enable Actions
failure notifications. Subscribe to each update issue. Schedules run on the default
branch and public repositories can lose scheduled execution after 60 days without
activity. If that happens, re-enable **Check upstream updates** in the fork's Actions
tab and manually dispatch it. Release email is the independent fallback.

**Adopt an update:** create a review branch from `personal`. Fetch upstream changes
in both repositories. Inspect the exact stable release tag and its reader pin
(`git ls-tree <tag> reader/reader`). Merge needed upstream reader changes on a reader
review branch, preserving annotation profiles; publish its reviewed result to the
reader's `personal` branch. Merge the exact ZotFlow release tag into the parent
review branch and resolve code conflicts individually. Keep the fork URL in
`.gitmodules`, check out the merged custom reader, and `git add reader/reader` to
record its exact pin. Do not blindly choose an entire side of a submodule conflict.

Run plugin and reader tests and the full build. Update `.github/upstream-state.json`
with the stable tag/commit and upstream reader commit actually integrated, keeping
the original development-base provenance. Merge the reviewed parent result into
`personal`, push it, and close the update issue. Independent reader updates use the
same process without changing the recorded ZotFlow stable release. Feature work
branches from `personal`; upstream contributions are prepared separately from the
owner's intended base, without personal tooling or submodule URL changes.

**Install:** close reader tabs and disable ZotFlow in the destination vault first.
Then run:

```bash
npm run install:personal -- --dry-run
npm run install:personal
npm run status:personal
```

The default vault is `~/vaults/tanners-vault`; all three commands accept
`--vault "/another/vault"`. Installation requires a clean `personal` branch and
initialized, clean submodules at their committed pins. It runs `npm test`, the
reader's tests, and `npm run build:ci` before copying anything. This always rebuilds
the reader rather than bundling stale assets. Enable ZotFlow again afterward.

Only `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, and the generated reader license
notice are managed. Settings, notes, annotation sidecars, credentials, and existing
Enhancement Pack contents are preserved. Ordinary copies keep everyday use separate
from the isolated harness's Hot Reload links. Do not add this installation to BRAT
or use the community directory's Update action: those would replace your custom
build. `status:personal` verifies hashes even when both builds have the same version.

Receipts and timestamped backups live under gitignored `.personal/`, keyed by vault.
The receipt records the parent/reader commits, upstream provenance, database schema,
and installed artifact hashes. A failed copy restores the previous artifact set.
For a verified backup from a prior personal build with the same database schema:

```bash
npm run rollback:personal -- --backup <id> --dry-run
npm run rollback:personal -- --backup <id>
```

Disable ZotFlow before rollback and enable it afterward. **Artifact rollback does
not undo database migrations or settings changes.** Unknown-schema installations
(including the original community build) are backed up but cannot be restored by
the automated rollback command. Cross-schema recovery needs separate review; never
delete IndexedDB to force a downgrade when it may hold unsynced edits. Run upgrade
tests only in the isolated profile with a dedicated Zotero test library.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 16
- npm

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duanxianpi/obsidian-zotflow.git --recursive
cd obsidian-zotflow
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build:ci       # Full CI build (PDF.js + reader + plugin)
npm run dev:plugin     # esbuild watch mode (plugin)
npm run dev:reader     # webpack watch mode (reader, separate terminal)
npm run lint
```

### Annotation profiles

Open **Settings → ZotFlow → Annotation Profiles** to create or duplicate a profile,
rename it, and edit/reorder its colors and optional labels. The protected **Zotero
default** keeps the original eight colors; duplicate it to customize it. Ink and
text retain the extra black option. A profile needs at least one color, and colors
within a profile must be distinct six-digit hex values.

The default profile applies to newly opened readers. The profile chooser inside a
reader changes only that open reader; reconnecting retains its choice, while
reopening the document starts with the settings default. Profile edits update
open readers. Removing their active profile falls back to the default. Existing
annotations keep their colors and tags, including colors removed from a palette.

Labels are display text. **Automatically tag new annotations** is a separate,
default-off option that adds a labeled entry's text as an ordinary Zotero annotation
tag at creation. It preserves other tags and avoids duplicates. It never retags
annotations when recoloring, editing, importing, or switching profiles.

Source-note labels resolve in this order:

1. An ordinary annotation tag matching a current or remembered category label.
   Matching is exact and case-sensitive; manually added matching tags count too.
   If several match, the earliest registered category wins.
2. The annotation color's label in the **settings default profile**. Temporary
   reader selections do not change source-note fallback labels.
3. **Other** if neither resolves.

ZotFlow remembers committed label names in its settings even after a label or
profile is deleted. This keeps tagged annotations' meaning stable across profile
changes. Share ZotFlow's settings between devices to retain that registry; Zotero
stores only ordinary colors and tags. Untagged older annotations use the current
color fallback, so their inferred display labels may change.

Under **General → Source Notes**, two default-off settings control built-in output:

- **Group annotations by category** creates category sections across attachments.
  Groups follow default-profile palette order, then historical registry order,
  with Other last. Within a group, annotations follow attachment key, document
  position, then annotation key. A category literally named Other shares the final
  group with uncategorized annotations.
- **Labeled annotation callout titles** applies when grouping is off. The original
  type/color callout remains, with its label as title and its attachment/page link
  in the body. Its preference is retained while grouping is on.

Both layouts preserve annotation links, images, block references, editable comments,
and user-owned persist regions. Settings apply on the next render; use **Force
update source note** (or **Force update all library source notes**) to refresh
unchanged library notes, and the local source-note update action for local files.

Custom templates remain authoritative. The options do not rewrite them. Every
annotation context adds `paletteLabel`, `categoryTags`, `category`, `resolvedLabel`,
and `labelSource` (`tag`, `color`, or `none`). `item.annotationGroups` and
`attachment.annotationGroups` expose `{ label, annotations }` groups; existing
annotation arrays retain their original order. `annotation.attachmentTitle` is
available for grouped attachment links. These are template fields only, not
annotation storage fields.

For example, a custom library template can opt into grouped output with:

```liquid
{% capture quote_prefix %}{{ newline }}> {% endcapture %}
{% for group in item.annotationGroups %}
## {{ group.label | annotation_label }}
{% for annotation in group.annotations %}
> [!quote] {{ annotation.resolvedLabel | default: "Other" | annotation_label }}
> [p.{{ annotation.pageLabel }}]({{ annotation | annotation_link }})
> {{ annotation.text | replace: newline, " " }}
>
> {{ annotation.comment | wrap_editable: "ANNO", annotation.key | replace: newline, quote_prefix }}
^{{ annotation.key }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

Use the `annotation_label` filter when inserting labels into Markdown headings or
callout titles: labels are plain text. The snippet illustrates text annotations;
retain your template's image and persist-region handling, or use the built-in
layouts for all annotation types. The template preview's built-in template includes
the selected presentation options and is a complete starting point for customization.

### Live testing in Obsidian

The local-only annotation profile regression needs no Zotero key. After building
and launching the isolated app, run `node tests/live/annotation-profiles.live.mjs`.
It creates named fixtures in the test vault and restores profile settings afterward.

`npm run live:obsidian` drives a separate Obsidian instance over the Chrome
DevTools Protocol. It runs with its own profile (`--user-data-dir`), so its
settings, IndexedDB and plugin state never touch your everyday Obsidian, which
can stay open.

Requirements: Obsidian installed, and a Zotero API key of your own, ideally
limited to a group you only use for testing (sync tests write to it).

```bash
npm run build:plugin
npm run live:obsidian -- setup
npm run live:obsidian -- launch
ZOTFLOW_TEST_API_KEY=<key> npm run live:obsidian -- login
```

`setup` creates a test vault (default `.obsidian-test/vault/`), hard-links
`main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` into
`.obsidian/plugins/zotflow/`, installs the
[Hot Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin (pinned version,
checksum-verified), and writes `.obsidian-test/config.json`. All of
`.obsidian-test/` is gitignored. Options:

| Option              | Default                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--vault <dir>`     | `.obsidian-test/vault`                              |
| `--profile <dir>`   | `.obsidian-test/profile`                            |
| `--port <n>`        | `9223`                                              |
| `--obsidian <exe>`  | macOS: `/Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS/Obsidian`; Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Obsidian\Obsidian.exe`; Linux: required |

For a live edit loop, run the build in watch mode:

```bash
npm run live:obsidian -- dev
```

esbuild rewrites `main.js` in place, which the hard link makes visible inside
the vault, so Hot Reload reloads the plugin after every rebuild (plain
`npm run dev:plugin` works too). Anything that replaces a file instead of
rewriting it, such as `git checkout` or an editor's atomic save, breaks its
link; `dev`, `launch` and `reload` re-check and repair the links. A vault on a
different volume than the repo gets copies instead, refreshed by the same
commands. `npm run live:obsidian -- reload` reloads the plugin by hand. Other
commands: `status`, `eval '<js>'`, `screenshot [out] [window]`,
`logs [seconds]`, `targets`, `quit`, and `reset` (deletes the profile for a
fresh start). The environment variables `ZF_OBSIDIAN_PATH`, `ZF_TEST_VAULT`,
`ZF_TEST_PROFILE` and `ZF_TEST_PORT` override the config.

### Fixture library

`npm run live:fixtures` keeps a known set of Zotero data in your test library:
collections, items of several types (including ones whose fields have their
own names, like cases and patents), notes, PDF/EPUB/HTML attachments, and
every annotation type. It only creates, updates and deletes objects it owns
(marked in `extra`, in the note HTML, or by being under a fixture item or the
`ZotFlow fixtures` collection), so other items in the library are left alone.
A dedicated test group is still recommended, since sync tests touch the whole
library.

```bash
ZOTFLOW_TEST_API_KEY=<key> npm run live:fixtures -- libraries   # pick a library
# then set "fixtureLibrary": "groups/<id>" in .obsidian-test/config.json
npm run live:fixtures -- plan      # what apply would change, read-only
npm run live:fixtures -- apply     # create the set, or reset it after tests
npm run live:fixtures -- purge --yes
```

The set is defined in `scripts/fixture-library.mjs`. Attachment files are
generated there, not stored: deterministic bytes, so a re-apply uploads
nothing unless the content changes, and annotations are placed on the
generated text. Each object's key derives from its fixture id
(`npm run live:fixtures -- keys attention-pdf`), so tests can address it directly.

### Live sync tests

`npm run live:sync` runs end-to-end sync tests against the test instance and
the fixture library: pull, push, conflicts, faults (requests dropped after the
server applied them, or never sent) and concurrency (another client writing
mid-sync). They need the instance launched, a fresh `npm run build:plugin`,
and `zoteroApiKey` plus a `groups/<id>` `fixtureLibrary` in
`.obsidian-test/config.json`. Every test resets the group to the fixture set,
so use a group you only use for testing. Run a subset with
`npm run live:sync -- pull conflicts`. `npm run live:sync -- server` probes,
straight against the API and without Obsidian, the server behaviour the sync
engine relies on (batch DELETE, `version: 0` creates, patch uploads, version
checks).
`npm run live:sync -- upgrade` lets the released 1.6.6 build make a database
full of pending edits and conflicts, then opens it with the current build
(the v7 migration) and syncs; it downloads that release's `main.js` once.

### Memory leak checks

With the test instance running (`npm run live:obsidian -- launch`):

```bash
npm run live:memory
```

Press Enter for a passive sample, use `g <label>` for a double-GC checkpoint,
and `q` to detach and quit. Samples are written to `.memory-logs/` as CSV.

### Local install

Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` to:

```
<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/zotflow/
```

The folder name must match the plugin id in `manifest.json`. Reload Obsidian
and enable the plugin.

### Maintainer release workflow

`dev` is the only long-lived development branch. `master` contains only code
that has already been published as a stable release. Feature branches merge
into `dev`; beta versions are immutable tags on existing `dev` commits, so no
beta version is committed to `package.json` or `manifest.json`.

After the `dev` CI run is green, preview or publish the next beta with:

```bash
npm run beta:next -- patch
npm run beta -- patch
```

The second command calculates the next `x.y.z-beta.N`, creates an annotated
tag, and pushes only that tag. Use `minor` or `major` instead of `patch` when
the beta targets that type of stable release. The tag workflow builds temporary
beta metadata and publishes a non-draft GitHub prerelease without changing the
branch files.

For a stable release, run `npm version patch`, `minor`, or `major` on `dev`,
push the commit and tag, and inspect the generated Draft Release. Publish the
release before merging that exact stable tag into `master`. Never move or reuse
a published tag.

## Privacy

- **No telemetry. No analytics. No tracking.**
- Network requests go only to the Zotero API and your configured WebDAV server.
- Credentials live in Obsidian's platform-native `SecretStorage`.
- The reader iframe communicates only via structured-clone messaging — no `eval`, no remote code.

## Acknowledgements

ZotFlow stands on the shoulders of some incredible open-source work. Huge thanks to the teams and individuals behind these projects — they inspired the design, shaped the architecture, and in some cases provided the actual engine running inside ZotFlow:

- **[Zotero Reader](https://github.com/zotero/reader)** — the PDF/EPUB/HTML reader engine embedded in ZotFlow. Without this, there's no reader.
- **[Task Genius](https://github.com/taskgenius)** — the embeddable Markdown editor in ZotFlow is powered by Task Genius, which made it possible to have a full-featured editor without building one from scratch.
- **[Zotero Web Library](https://github.com/zotero/web-library)** — reference for understanding Zotero's data model and UI patterns.
- **[Obsidian Zotero Integration](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-zotero-integration)** by mgmeyers — the battle-tested original that countless researchers rely on. ZotFlow owes a lot to its design decisions.
- **[ZotLit](https://github.com/aidenlx/zotlit)** by aidenlx — a beautiful, thoughtfully built plugin that pushed the bar for what Zotero+Obsidian integration could look like.
- **[Zotero Better Notes](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes)** by windingwind — inspired ZotFlow's approach to seamless note editing and the tight Markdown↔HTML note sync loop.
