# ZotFlow — Keep Your Research in Flow

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> **Your Zotero library, your reader, your notes — one seamless workspace inside Obsidian.**

ZotFlow is a community plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that brings the full power of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) into your vault. Read papers, annotate PDFs, generate templated source notes, and cite literature — all without ever leaving Obsidian.

## Why ZotFlow?

If any of these sound like you, ZotFlow was built for you:

- 📚 You want to **read and annotate PDFs/EPUBs** without switching between Zotero, a PDF viewer, and Obsidian.
- 🎨 You want your reader to **match your Obsidian theme** — dark mode, custom fonts, the works.
- 🔄 You want **true bidirectional sync** — annotations made in Obsidian flow back to Zotero, and vice versa.
- ✍️ You want every Zotero item to have an **auto-generated, template-driven source note** that always stays up to date.
- 🔗 You want to **cite literature** in Pandoc, Wikilink, Footnote, or raw citekey format — by drag-and-drop, autocomplete, or hotkey.
- 📂 You want to annotate **any PDF or EPUB already in your vault**, even ones that aren't in Zotero.
- 🛡️ You want an **offline-first, privacy-respecting** tool with no telemetry and secure credential storage.

## What You Can Do With ZotFlow

### 🪟 Read & Annotate Inside Obsidian

A full-featured PDF/EPUB/HTML reader, embedded right in your workspace and **themed to match Obsidian**. Highlight, underline, draw, add sticky notes, capture image regions — every annotation type Zotero supports, in a window that finally feels like home.

![Built-in Reader](assets/reader.gif)

### 🔄 True Bidirectional Sync

Pull items, metadata, and annotations from Zotero — and push your changes back. Configure each library independently as **Bidirectional**, **Read-Only**, or **Ignored**. Sync works like Zotero's own: changes to different fields (or different tags) on both sides merge automatically, and only a field changed differently on both sides — or an item deleted on one side and changed on the other — becomes a conflict. A field-level diff viewer lets you decide what to keep; items deleted in Zotero together are resolved together.

### ✨ Template-Powered Source Notes

Every Zotero item gets one auto-generated Markdown note, rendered with [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com) templates you fully control.

### 🗒️ Native Zotero Item Notes

Create, edit, and delete **Zotero child notes** without leaving Obsidian. Right-click any item in the Tree View to add a note, edit it in a dedicated tab with Obsidian's full Markdown editor, or unlock its region inside the parent source note and edit in place. Every change auto-saves and syncs back to Zotero.

### 📝 Annotate Any Vault File

Have PDFs or EPUBs that aren't in Zotero? Open them with the same reader. Annotations save into a co-located `.zf.json` sidecar — no Zotero account required. Perfect for personal notes, downloaded papers, or books you're reading.

### 📎 Multi-Format Citations

Insert citations as **Pandoc** (`[@key]`), **Wikilink** (`[[Source/@key|Author (year)]]`), **Footnote**, or raw **citekey** — via drag-and-drop from the tree view, autocomplete with a trigger string (`@@`), or copy-from-reader hotkeys. Include annotation context (page numbers, quoted text) automatically.

### 🌳 Zotero Tree View & Search Modal

Browse your entire Zotero universe — libraries, collections, items, attachments — in a fast virtualized sidebar tree. Search, sort, drag, right-click. Click any attachment to open it; drag any item to cite it.

Or open the search modal from the command palette, type to filter your library, and hit Enter to jump to an item or open its attachment.

### 🛠️ And a Whole Lot More

- **WebDAV support** — download attachments from your self-hosted Zotero storage.
- **Linked attachment base directory** — works with Zotero's external file storage feature.
- **Batch operations** — generate every source note, extract every annotation image, re-render every template in one click.
- **Activity Center** — a control panel for sync progress, running tasks, and a searchable log console.
- **Offline-first** — everything cached locally in IndexedDB; the network is only used for Zotero and WebDAV.
- **Secure credentials** — API keys stored in Obsidian's platform-native `SecretStorage`, never in synced `data.json`.
- **Mobile-aware** — built to be mobile-safe (current mobile support is limited).

## Quick Start

New to ZotFlow? Start here:

👉 **[Read the docs website](https://zotflow.peterduan.dev/)** — the documentation site introduces ZotFlow's key concepts and design philosophy first, then walks you through installation and your first sync.

For the impatient:

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**, search for **ZotFlow**, install and enable it. (Or grab it from the [Obsidian plugin directory](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/zotflow).)
2. Create a [Zotero API key](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new) with read/write access.
3. Paste it into **Settings → ZotFlow → Sync** and click **Verify Key**.
4. Open the **Activity Center** (ribbon icon) → **Sync All**.
5. Open the **Zotero Tree View**, double-click an attachment, and start reading.

## Architecture

ZotFlow uses a **Main Thread + Web Worker** split for responsiveness:

- **Main thread** — Obsidian API, UI rendering (React for complex views, native APIs for settings).
- **Web Worker** — Zotero API calls, sync engine, IndexedDB (Dexie), template rendering, PDF processing.
- **Reader iframe** — Zotero's PDF/EPUB/HTML reader, embedded and sandboxed via penpal.

Communication: [Comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink) (main ↔ worker) and [Penpal](https://github.com/nicmeriano/penpal) (main ↔ reader iframe).

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 16
- npm

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duanxianpi/obsidian-zotflow.git --recursive
cd obsidian-zotflow
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build:ci       # Full CI build (PDF.js + reader + plugin)
npm run dev:plugin     # esbuild watch mode (plugin)
npm run dev:reader     # webpack watch mode (reader, separate terminal)
npm run lint
```

### Live testing in Obsidian

`npm run live:obsidian` drives a separate Obsidian instance over the Chrome
DevTools Protocol. It runs with its own profile (`--user-data-dir`), so its
settings, IndexedDB and plugin state never touch your everyday Obsidian, which
can stay open.

Requirements: Obsidian installed, and a Zotero API key of your own, ideally
limited to a group you only use for testing (sync tests write to it).

```bash
npm run build:plugin
npm run live:obsidian -- setup
npm run live:obsidian -- launch
ZOTFLOW_TEST_API_KEY=<key> npm run live:obsidian -- login
```

`setup` creates a test vault (default `.obsidian-test/vault/`), hard-links
`main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` into
`.obsidian/plugins/zotflow/`, installs the
[Hot Reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) plugin (pinned version,
checksum-verified), and writes `.obsidian-test/config.json`. All of
`.obsidian-test/` is gitignored. Options:

| Option              | Default                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--vault <dir>`     | `.obsidian-test/vault`                              |
| `--profile <dir>`   | `.obsidian-test/profile`                            |
| `--port <n>`        | `9223`                                              |
| `--obsidian <exe>`  | macOS: `/Applications/Obsidian.app/Contents/MacOS/Obsidian`; Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Obsidian\Obsidian.exe`; Linux: required |

For a live edit loop, run the build in watch mode:

```bash
npm run live:obsidian -- dev
```

esbuild rewrites `main.js` in place, which the hard link makes visible inside
the vault, so Hot Reload reloads the plugin after every rebuild (plain
`npm run dev:plugin` works too). Anything that replaces a file instead of
rewriting it, such as `git checkout` or an editor's atomic save, breaks its
link; `dev`, `launch` and `reload` re-check and repair the links. A vault on a
different volume than the repo gets copies instead, refreshed by the same
commands. `npm run live:obsidian -- reload` reloads the plugin by hand. Other
commands: `status`, `eval '<js>'`, `screenshot [out] [window]`,
`logs [seconds]`, `targets`, `quit`, and `reset` (deletes the profile for a
fresh start). The environment variables `ZF_OBSIDIAN_PATH`, `ZF_TEST_VAULT`,
`ZF_TEST_PROFILE` and `ZF_TEST_PORT` override the config.

### Fixture library

`npm run live:fixtures` keeps a known set of Zotero data in your test library:
collections, items of several types (including ones whose fields have their
own names, like cases and patents), notes, PDF/EPUB/HTML attachments, and
every annotation type. It only creates, updates and deletes objects it owns
(marked in `extra`, in the note HTML, or by being under a fixture item or the
`ZotFlow fixtures` collection), so other items in the library are left alone.
A dedicated test group is still recommended, since sync tests touch the whole
library.

```bash
ZOTFLOW_TEST_API_KEY=<key> npm run live:fixtures -- libraries   # pick a library
# then set "fixtureLibrary": "groups/<id>" in .obsidian-test/config.json
npm run live:fixtures -- plan      # what apply would change, read-only
npm run live:fixtures -- apply     # create the set, or reset it after tests
npm run live:fixtures -- purge --yes
```

The set is defined in `scripts/fixture-library.mjs`. Attachment files are
generated there, not stored: deterministic bytes, so a re-apply uploads
nothing unless the content changes, and annotations are placed on the
generated text. Each object's key derives from its fixture id
(`npm run live:fixtures -- keys attention-pdf`), so tests can address it directly.

### Live sync tests

`npm run live:sync` runs end-to-end sync tests against the test instance and
the fixture library: pull, push, conflicts, faults (requests dropped after the
server applied them, or never sent) and concurrency (another client writing
mid-sync). They need the instance launched, a fresh `npm run build:plugin`,
and `zoteroApiKey` plus a `groups/<id>` `fixtureLibrary` in
`.obsidian-test/config.json`. Every test resets the group to the fixture set,
so use a group you only use for testing. Run a subset with
`npm run live:sync -- pull conflicts`. `npm run live:sync -- server` probes,
straight against the API and without Obsidian, the server behaviour the sync
engine relies on (batch DELETE, `version: 0` creates, patch uploads, version
checks).
`npm run live:sync -- upgrade` lets the released 1.6.6 build make a database
full of pending edits and conflicts, then opens it with the current build
(the v7 migration) and syncs; it downloads that release's `main.js` once.

### Memory leak checks

With the test instance running (`npm run live:obsidian -- launch`):

```bash
npm run live:memory
```

Press Enter for a passive sample, use `g <label>` for a double-GC checkpoint,
and `q` to detach and quit. Samples are written to `.memory-logs/` as CSV.

### Local install

Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` to:

```
<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/zotflow/
```

The folder name must match the plugin id in `manifest.json`. Reload Obsidian
and enable the plugin.

### Maintainer release workflow

`dev` is the only long-lived development branch. `master` contains only code
that has already been published as a stable release. Feature branches merge
into `dev`; beta versions are immutable tags on existing `dev` commits, so no
beta version is committed to `package.json` or `manifest.json`.

After the `dev` CI run is green, preview or publish the next beta with:

```bash
npm run beta:next -- patch
npm run beta -- patch
```

The second command calculates the next `x.y.z-beta.N`, creates an annotated
tag, and pushes only that tag. Use `minor` or `major` instead of `patch` when
the beta targets that type of stable release. The tag workflow builds temporary
beta metadata and publishes a non-draft GitHub prerelease without changing the
branch files.

For a stable release, run `npm version patch`, `minor`, or `major` on `dev`,
push the commit and tag, and inspect the generated Draft Release. Publish the
release before merging that exact stable tag into `master`. Never move or reuse
a published tag.

## Privacy

- **No telemetry. No analytics. No tracking.**
- Network requests go only to the Zotero API and your configured WebDAV server.
- Credentials live in Obsidian's platform-native `SecretStorage`.
- The reader iframe communicates only via structured-clone messaging — no `eval`, no remote code.

## Acknowledgements

ZotFlow stands on the shoulders of some incredible open-source work. Huge thanks to the teams and individuals behind these projects — they inspired the design, shaped the architecture, and in some cases provided the actual engine running inside ZotFlow:

- **[Zotero Reader](https://github.com/zotero/reader)** — the PDF/EPUB/HTML reader engine embedded in ZotFlow. Without this, there's no reader.
- **[Task Genius](https://github.com/taskgenius)** — the embeddable Markdown editor in ZotFlow is powered by Task Genius, which made it possible to have a full-featured editor without building one from scratch.
- **[Zotero Web Library](https://github.com/zotero/web-library)** — reference for understanding Zotero's data model and UI patterns.
- **[Obsidian Zotero Integration](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-zotero-integration)** by mgmeyers — the battle-tested original that countless researchers rely on. ZotFlow owes a lot to its design decisions.
- **[ZotLit](https://github.com/aidenlx/zotlit)** by aidenlx — a beautiful, thoughtfully built plugin that pushed the bar for what Zotero+Obsidian integration could look like.
- **[Zotero Better Notes](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes)** by windingwind — inspired ZotFlow's approach to seamless note editing and the tight Markdown↔HTML note sync loop.
